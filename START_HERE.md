## Your 4-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: Read the Overview (2 minutes)
**Open**: `PROJECT_READY.md`

This gives you the complete project summary with:
- What you have
- How to test it
- Next steps for deployment

### Step 2: Setup the Application (5 minutes)
**Run this one command**:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This automatically:
- Creates Python virtual environment
- Installs all backend dependencies
- Installs all frontend packages
- Configures everything

### Step 3: Start the Services (2 terminals, 1 minute each)

**Terminal 1 - Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate    # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Open Browser**: http://localhost:5173

### Step 4: Test with Your Data (10 minutes)
**Follow**: `TESTING_GUIDE.md`

This guide has 6 test scenarios:
1. Sample data test (quick verification)
2. Your own resume test (real data)
3. Edge cases test (robustness)
4. Admin panel test (customization)
5. File format test (PDF/DOCX/TXT)
6. UI/UX test (responsiveness)

2. Customize the scoring (if needed)
3. Deploy to production (optional)
4. Share with others

### If Tests Fail
1. Check **Troubleshooting** in README.md
2. Verify both services are running
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Verify all dependencies installed
